I'm third year PhD student at the School of Informatics at the Technical University of Munich, where I am advised by [Martin Bichler](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/dss/bichler/). I am a member of the [Chair of Decision Sciences and Systems](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/dss/home/) and  the interdisciplinary research training group [Advanced Optimization in a Networked Economy (AdONE)](https://www.gs.tum.de/en/adone/start/). My research lies at the intersection of theoretical computer science and operations researc. I am interested in problems related to algorithmic game theory, mechanism design and computational complexity.

I obtained my MSc in Computer Science from Aarhus University, Denmark, where I was advised by [Kristoffer Arnsfelt Hansen](https://www.cs.au.dk/~arnsfelt/). Prior to that, I received my Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, under the supervision of [Dimitris Fotakis](https://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/).
